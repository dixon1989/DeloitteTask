### API Server (IMPORTANT! Pleas Make sure that you run the server first If not please refer to 'What if you can't run api server?')

Your solution will require interaction with a local API server that provides data.

To start the server, use a separate terminal window with the following:

1. Change into the `server` directory and run `npm install`
2. Start the server via `npm run start`

The following 2 endpoints will now be available.

| Endpoint                             | Description                       |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| http://localhost:8001/launches       | returns an array of launch data   |
| http://localhost:8001/launchpads     | returns launchpads                |

Steps to run Project: 
1. navigate to your react folder look for ./deloittetask
2. Install dependencies by running 'yarn' or 'npm install'
3. Once dependencies has been installed. Run 'yarn start' / 'npm start'
4. Enjoy

What if you can't run api server? 
- The launch.json file is already located in this <root>/public/ folder.
- Location on where I retrieve data is located at src/api/getData.js
- If you have a different way of retrieving data kindly modify it at src/api/getData.js

Other additional implementation.
- Add a no result found when there are not result to be displayed
- Added git - you can view git history by running git-log
